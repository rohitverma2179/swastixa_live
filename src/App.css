        question: "Q3: What's the minimum budget needed to go digital?",

        question: "Q4: Will digital marketing work for my local/traditional business type? ",
        answer:
          "Yes. Every business benefits from being discoverable online. Whether you're a local contractor, retail store, manufacturer, or service provider, customers search online before making decisions. Digital marketing helps you show up in those searches."
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: How do I measure if digital marketing is working?",
        answer:
          "Track three simple metrics weekly: website visitors, leads generated (calls, forms, messages), and cost per lead if running ads. After 60 days of consistent effort, you should see upward trends in traffic and inquiries. "
