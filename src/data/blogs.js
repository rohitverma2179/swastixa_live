        answer:
          "A basic digital presence (website, Google Business Profile, active social media) can be established in 30–60 days. Seeing measurable results from SEO and content takes 60–90 days, while paid ads can generate leads within the first week if set up correctly."
      },
      {
        question: "Q2: Do I need to hire a full-time digital marketing team? ",
        answer:
          "No. Most traditional SMEs start by outsourcing to a digital marketing agency or working with freelancers. As your digital presence grows, you can decide whether to build an in-house team or continue outsourcing."
      },
      {
        question: "Q3: What's the minimum budget needed to go digital?",
        answer:
          "You can start with ₹25,000–₹50,000 for a basic website and ₹10,000–₹15,000/month for paid ads and content. Many foundational activities like Google Business Profile setup, organic social media, and email collection are free. "
      },
      {
        question: "Q4: Will digital marketing work for my local/traditional business type? ",
        answer:
          "Yes. Every business benefits from being discoverable online. Whether you're a local contractor, retail store, manufacturer, or service provider, customers search online before making decisions. Digital marketing helps you show up in those searches."
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: How do I measure if digital marketing is working?",
        answer:
          "Track three simple metrics weekly: website visitors, leads generated (calls, forms, messages), and cost per lead if running ads. After 60 days of consistent effort, you should see upward trends in traffic and inquiries. "

        question: "Q1: Which social media platform is best for local businesses in India?",
        answer:
          "Facebook is the best starting point for most local businesses because of its broad demographic reach (25–55 years), strong local discovery features, and high engagement from users with purchasing power. Instagram works better for visually-driven businesses like food, fashion, and interiors."
      },
      {
        question: "Q2: How often should a local business post on social media?",
        answer:
          "Minimum 3 posts per week on your primary platform. Ideal frequency is 5–7 posts per week on Facebook, 5 posts + 7 Stories + 3 Reels per week on Instagram. Consistency matters more than volume."
      },
      {
        question: "Q3: How long does it take to see results from social media marketing?",
        answer:
          "Organic social media typically shows measurable results (increased followers, engagement, and inquiries) within 60–90 days of consistent posting. Paid social ads can generate leads within days if your profile and content strategy are ready."
      },
      {
        question: "Q4: Can I manage social media without hiring someone? ",
        answer:
          "Yes, if you dedicate 5–7 hours per week: 2–3 hours for content creation, 30 minutes per day for posting and engagement, and 30 minutes per week for analytics. Batching content creation and using scheduling tools makes this manageable."
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: What type of content gets the most engagement for local businesses?",
        answer:
          "Educational content (tips, how-tos), customer success stories (before/after, testimonials), and behind-the-scenes content consistently perform best. Video content (Reels, Stories) gets 2–3x more engagement than static images."

          "SCO typically shows initial results in 3-4 months, with significant impact by 6-9 months. It's slower than some traditional SEO tactics but delivers more sustainable, long-term growth."
      },
      {
        question: "Q4: Is SCO more expensive than traditional SEO?",
        answer:
          "High-quality content requires more investment upfront but delivers better ROI long-term. Expect ₹25,000-45,000 monthly for quality SCO vs ₹15,000-30,000 for basic traditional SEO. "
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: Can small businesses compete with SCO against big competitors?",
        answer:
          "Yes. SCO levels the playing field—smaller businesses creating genuinely helpful content can outrank larger competitors with shallow, keyword-focused content. Quality beats budget in SCO. "

        question: "Q1: Which content format gets the most reach on Instagram?",
        answer:
          "Reels currently get 3-5x more reach than static posts or carousels on Instagram. Instagram's algorithm heavily promotes reels to both followers and non-followers."
      },
      {
        question: "Q2: Are carousels still effective in 2025?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Carousels have the highest save rate of any Instagram format, indicating high perceived value. They work exceptionally well for educational content and on LinkedIn."
      },
      {
        question: "Q3: How long should explainer videos be?",
        answer:
          "For social media: 30-90 seconds. For websites: 1-3 minutes. For YouTube: 3-10 minutes. Shorter is better unless complexity requires longer explanation"
      },
      {
        question: "Q4: Can I post the same content in different formats?",
        answer:
          "Yes, this is called content repurposing and is highly recommended. Create one piece of core content and adapt it into multiple formats for different platforms."
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: Which format is easiest to create consistently?",
        answer:
          "Carousels require least production effort—create in Canva with templates, no video editing needed. Reels require more effort but free tools like CapCut make it manageable."

          "Basic fixes (speed optimization, form simplification, mobile responsiveness) can cost ₹15,000–₹40,000. A complete redesign typically ranges from ₹80,000–₹2,50,000 depending on complexity."

        question: "Q1: How far in advance should I plan social media content?",
        answer:
          "Plan 30 days at a time for best results. This provides enough structure to stay consistent while leaving room for timely, spontaneous posts when opportunities arise."
      },
      {
        question: "Q2: What's the ideal posting frequency for small businesses?",
        answer:
          "Aim for 3–5 posts per week minimum. Consistency matters more than volume—better to post 3 times weekly every week than 10 times one week and nothing the next."
      },
      {
        question: "Q3: Should I use the same content across all social media platforms?",
        answer:
          "Repurpose core content but adapt format and tone for each platform. LinkedIn prefers professional insights, Instagram favors visual storytelling, and Facebook works for community engagement."
      },
      {
        question: "Q4: How long should I spend creating each social media post?",
        answer:
          "When batching, aim for 15–20 minutes per post including caption writing. Individual daily creation typically takes 30–45 minutes per post due to context switching."
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: What tools are best for scheduling social media posts?",
        answer:
          "Meta Business Suite (free for Facebook/Instagram), Buffer, Later, and Hootsuite are reliable options. Choose based on your platforms and whether you need analytics or team collaboration features."

        question: "Q1: How long should I commit to a digital marketing agency initially?",
        answer:
          "Start with a 3-month trial period to evaluate working relationship and initial results. Avoid 12-month contracts upfront unless you've worked with them before and trust their capabilities."
      },
      {
        question: "Q2: Should I hire a specialist or a full-service agency?",
        answer:
          "If you need one specific service (like only Google Ads), hire a specialist. For comprehensive digital presence requiring multiple services, a full-service agency provides better coordination and strategy."
      },
      {
        question: "Q3: What questions reveal if an agency is actually good?",
        answer:
          "Ask for case studies similar to your business, realistic timelines, who will work on your account, and 3 client references you can contact. Good agencies answer confidently with specifics."
      },
      {
        question: "Q4: How much should small businesses budget for digital marketing?",
        answer:
          "Allocate 7-12% of revenue for marketing, with 40-60% of that toward digital. For most SMEs, this means ₹30,000-₹80,000 monthly for effective digital marketing services."
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: What's the biggest mistake businesses make when hiring agencies?",
        answer:
          "Choosing based on price alone. The cheapest option usually delivers the worst results, costing more in wasted time and lost opportunities than hiring quality from the start."

        question: "Q4: How quickly can a full-stack team execute new campaigns?",

        question: "Q5: What's the minimum commitment for full-stack digital marketing?",
        answer:

        question: "Q1: How long before I see results from digital marketing?",
        answer:
          "Initial results appear in month 3-4 (increased visibility, early leads). Significant, consistent results typically develop by month 5-6. Full optimization and predictable growth by month 9-12."
      },
      {
        question: "Q2: What results should I expect in the first 90 days?",
        answer:
          "First 90 days focus on foundation and initial visibility. Expect 300-600 monthly website visitors, consistent social presence, and 10-20 total inquiries by end of month 3."
      },
      {
        question: "Q3: How much budget do I need for this growth process?",
        answer:
          "Minimum ₹40,000-50,000 monthly for comprehensive digital marketing (strategy, content, ads management). Plus ₹10,000-25,000 monthly ad spend depending on industry and competition."

      {
        question: "Q4: What happens if results don't meet expectations?",
        answer:
          "After month 3, we review data together. If strategy needs adjustment, we pivot. If execution needs improvement, we fix it. Full transparency about what's working and what needs change."
      },
      {
        question: "Q5: Can I start with lower budget and scale up?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but understand that lower budgets mean slower growth. Starting with ₹25,000-30,000 monthly works but extends timelines by 30-50%. Quality requires minimum viable investment."
